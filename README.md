This repository aims to satisfy the project outline for STAT 4620 - Data Analysis

Canada has put extensive research into collecting valuable oceanographic data by placing multiple buoys along the coastlines. 
For this report, raw time series data from 4 different buoys selected along the coast of Nova Scotia were combined and sorted, 
in an attempt to accurately predict wave heights based on a random forest model. 
Other scientific questions will be answered during the data exploration stages. 
Model performance will be based on R-squared and mean root mean squared error values.
